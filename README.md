# Midi-Piano
Assignment for CS2012 module - Midi Piano Applet (using Java Applets)

## Features
> * The notes of the octave above middle C are played on the numeric keys, starting with 1 on the left and ending with the = key on the right, with a semitone between each (so that each pair of adjacent keys corresponds to a pair of adjacent keys on a real piano, including the black ones).

> * Holding a key down sustains the note, and several notes can be played at once.

> * Different instruments can be chosen. Pressing the I key cycles through the available midi instruments.

> * You can record and play back sequences of notes. Pressing the R key starts recording, and pressing it again stops recording. During recording, a red indicator is shown; this turns back to green when recording ends. Pressing P causes the last recorded sequence to be played back.

> * Music looping can be achieved (by playing notes on top of playback notes while recording). 

A slight annoyance: you'll need to click on the applet's panel with your mouse to give it keyboard focus before playing any notes.
